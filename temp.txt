By default

these input fields like this input and also this select

they maintain their own state inside the DOM.

So basically inside the HTML element itself.

Now this makes it hard to read their values

and it also leaves this state right here in the DOM

which for many reasons is not ideal.

So in React, we usually like to keep all this state

in just one central place.

So inside the React application and not inside the DOM.

And so in order to do that we use a technique

called controlled elements.

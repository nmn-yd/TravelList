# README for Trip Packing List Tracker

The Trip Packing List Tracker is a Application that allows users to keep track of the items they need to take on their trip. It helps users to maintain a list of items, their quantities, and easily manage the packing process. Users can add, remove, and check off items from the list as they pack their bags.

Features
Add Items: Users can add new items and their quantities to the packing list.

Remove Items: Users can remove items from the packing list.

Check Items: Users can check off items from the packing list once they have been packed.

View List: Users can view the entire packing list with all the items, quantities, and their packing status.

Save List: The tool automatically saves the packing list to a file, so users can resume their progress later.
